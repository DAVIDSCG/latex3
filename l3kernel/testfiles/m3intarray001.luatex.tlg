This is a coding error.
LaTeX has been asked to create a new control sequence '\g_testa_intarray' but
this name has already been used elsewhere.
The current meaning is:

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
